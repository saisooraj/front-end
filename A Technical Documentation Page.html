            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
                    JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. This happens in games, in the behavior of 
                    responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core 
                    JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, 
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, 
                        and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side 
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the 
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of 
                    power and creativity. However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. 
                    You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's create a basic "Hello world!" greeting example.
                </p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                      greetMe("World!");
                </code>
                <p>
                    The function has created a pop up "Hello world!"" using JavaScript. You did this by using a function to alert the "World" property when the function is called.
                </p>
            </article>

        <section id="variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because 
                    JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values, and you can declare a variable in three ways:
                    In this example x, y, and z, are all declared variables:
                </p>
                <code>
                    var x = 42
                </code>
                <code>
                    let y = 13
                </code>
                <code>
                    const x = 42
                </code>
                <p>
                    These syntax variables can be used to declare local, global, and block global variables. <em>(see References tab for more details)</em>.

            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript variables can hold many various data types. The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strings. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>Numbers. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>Booleans. True and False.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <code>
                    var length = 16; // Number var lastName = "Johnson"; // String var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; // Object
                </code>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and 
                    functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as 
                    procedures that your application can perform.

            <header>Conditionals</header>
            <article>
                <p>Conditional Statements (also known as if statements) are used when you want to perform different actions for different decisions.
                    YUse the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement 
                    if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) { block of code to be executed if the condition is true } else { block of code to be executed if the condition is false }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. 
                    If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, 
                    including further nested if statements.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    You may also compound the statements using "else if" to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                    } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                <p>
                    In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, 
                    group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements.
                    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code.

            <header>Loops</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Loops can execute a block of code a number of times, and are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
                    Often this is the case when working with arrays and objects. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
                    <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
                    <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
                    <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Below is an example of a While loop. The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
                </p>
                <code>
                    while (i < 10) { text += "The number is " + i; i++; }
                </code>
                <p>
                    In the example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em><strong>If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.</strong></em>

                    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" 
                    invokes it (calls it). Take the given code below:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function myFunction(p1, p2) { return p1 * p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2 }
                </code>
                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function</p>
                <code>
                    var x = myFunction(4, 3); // Function is called, return value will end up in x function myFunction(a, b) { return a * b; // Function returns the product of a and b }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The result will be <code>12</code>
                </p>
